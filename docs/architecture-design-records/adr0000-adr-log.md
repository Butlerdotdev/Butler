# ADR 0000: Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Status
Accepted

## Context
As Butler evolves, we need a structured and transparent way to document architecture decisions. Using **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** will allow us to:

- **Maintain a historical record** of decisions.
- **Provide context** for why decisions were made.
- **Enable collaboration** and review of major technical choices.
- **Ensure consistency** across the project.

## Decision
We will use **Markdown-based ADRs** stored in a dedicated `docs/adr/` directory within the Butler repository. Each ADR will be numbered sequentially (e.g., `0000-use-adrs.md`, `0001-choose-kamaji.md`).

ADRs will follow this structure:

```
# ADR XXXX: Title

## Status
(Proposed, Accepted, Superseded, Rejected)

## Context
(Explain the background and why this decision is needed)

## Decision
(Describe the choice made and why)

## Consequences
(Outline the impact of this decision, including trade-offs and future implications)
```

## Consequences
- All major architectural and technical decisions must be documented as an ADR.
- ADRs will be reviewed and approved via pull requests.
- Future ADRs may supersede previous ones, ensuring flexibility as requirements evolve.
